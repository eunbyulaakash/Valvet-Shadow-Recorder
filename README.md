A privacy-focused notes application with built-in audio & video recording.<br>
Velvet Notes & Recorder combines a clean notes experience with smart recording tools — all while keeping user data local, secure, and fully under control.

Designed with simplicity, discretion, and performance in mind.

Built with Flutter — not just another wrapper 😉
